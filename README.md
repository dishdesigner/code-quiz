## Description
* This application provides a simple interactive quiz about the Javascript programming language.
* The opening screen explains the quiz and its scoring.
* The player starts the quiz with a button click, and a timer begins to count from 120 seconds down to zero.
* When a user clicks an answer choice, the result is displayed as correct or incorrect.
* If the answer is correct, 10 points are added to the score.
* If incorrect, 10 seconds is removed from the timer and no points are scored.
* If the timer reaches zero or if all the questions are answered, the game ends.
* At the end of the game, the high score board is displayed.
* The user has the option of recording the previous score or beginning a new game.

### Extensions of the Quiz application
A future version of this simple quiz application might include:
* Randomizer that displays answers and questions in random order
* Randomizer that fills out the list beyond the correct answer with wrong answers from a long list of incorrect choices to thwart easy retaking of the quiz to beat the timer
* Ability for a user to choose a quiz length (in numbers of questions) and a difficulty level
* Multiple categories of questions within the Javascript language
* "Reverse engineering" animated GIF screenshot questions that show an application in action then ask how to achieve its functionality using Javascript
* Animations and sound effects during play for correct / incorrect answers and high scores
